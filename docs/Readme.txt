Module Description
This is a module made in order to display or download a document only for groups authorized.
You can (and should) protect the file from direct link by .htaccess (deny from all).
The script file.php "reads" the file to the visitor, so that the real file url is hidden.

You can rename the module very easily:
1/ rename the module directory
2/ change the name of the directory module in the xoops_version.php file
line 37:
$modversion['dirname'] = "acces_restreint";
